> A minimal static site generator. Your best friend.

"m8t", pronounced "mate", is yet another static site generator, built to power the original author's
[website](https://gedge.ca).

> [!NOTE]
> This project is currently being developed and will hopefully be available by Summer 2025

## Core values

- **Simplicity and minimalism**. The core should be as light as possible, satisfying the needs of most out of the box.
- **Easy to extend**. The defaults should suit most needs, but following the
  [Open-closed principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open%E2%80%93closed_principle), anyone needing to extend the
  core should be able to do so.
- **Truly static output**. You should be able to take the output of m8t and put it anywhere that can host static sites.
  There should be no need for functions or compute.
- **Lightweight output**. m8t does as little as possible when transforming, and should output just the stuff you need.

m8t's values are inspired by other technologies like [Express](https://expressjs.com/),
[Sinatra](https://sinatrarb.com/), [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/), and
[Lume](https://lume.land/).

## Why the name?

"m8t" is a numerical contraction of "minimalist", which is one of the values of this static site generator.
